# Evaluation of Ranking Performance

Based on the provided keywords and ranking data, the ranking goal for the URL `https://www.salesforce.com/de/marketing/b2b-automation/b2b-marketing-guide/` is **Partially Achieved**.

## Summary of Analysis

*   The primary keyword "B2B Marketing" is ranking, but outside the desired top 3 positions.
*   Two of the three secondary keywords are ranking via very close semantic variants, also outside the top 3.
*   One secondary keyword, "B2B Content Marketing," does not appear in the provided ranking data.

Because the most important keywords are present in the rankings but not in the target positions, and one keyword is missing, this performance fits the definition of "**Partially Achieved**."

## Detailed Breakdown

Let's compare the target keywords to the actual ranking data:

### Primary Keyword: "B2B Marketing"

*   **Target:** B2B Marketing
*   **Actual:** Found ranking at position 5.

**Note:** A close variant, `b-to b marketing`, is ranking at position 3. This is a very positive sign, but the exact match is outside the top 3.

### Secondary Keyword: "B2B Online-Marketing"

*   **Target:** B2B Online-Marketing
*   **Actual:** A strong semantic equivalent, `b2b marketing digital`, is found ranking at position 12.

### Secondary Keyword: "B2B Marketing Strategie"

*   **Target:** B2B Marketing Strategie
*   **Actual:** A direct variant, `marketingstrategien b2b` (marketing strategies b2b), is found ranking at position 5.

### Secondary Keyword: "B2B Content Marketing"

*   **Target:** B2B Content Marketing
*   **Actual:** This keyword was not found in the provided list of rankings.

## Conclusion

The goal was not **Fully Achieved** because none of the exact target keywords are ranking in positions 1-3. It was also not **Not Achieved**, because the primary keyword and two secondary keywords are clearly represented in the rankings. Therefore, the performance is best described as **Partially Achieved**. The page has established relevance for the core topics but requires further optimization to reach the top positions and to rank for all its target keywords.

| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

# Top Rankings Comparison

## Compared with `https://omr.com/de/daily/glossary/b2b-marketing`

### Content Gap Analysis

The competitive article (OMR) covers several practical and conceptual topics that your article (Salesforce) does not, making it feel more like a comprehensive, unbiased educational resource.

#### Explicit Discussion of Decision-Making Psychology:

*   OMR clearly states that B2B purchasing decisions are less emotional and more **wirtschaftlich orientiert** (economically oriented) than B2C decisions. Your article implies this but never states it directly, which is a key foundational concept.

#### Structured Framework for Target Audience Analysis:

*   OMR provides a detailed, actionable breakdown of **B2B-Kundensegmentierungs-Methoden** (B2B Customer Segmentation Methods). This is a significant content gap.
    *   **Soziodemografische Merkmale:** (Industry, company size, location).
    *   **Ökonomische Merkmale:** (Purchasing behavior, purchase volume, price sensitivity, liquidity).
    *   **Psychologische Merkmale / Werte:** (Willingness to innovate, price consciousness, ecological/ethical values).
    *   **Bedarfsanalyse:** (Needs analysis - frequency of use, replacement needs).
    *   **Points of Sale:** (Analysis of touchpoints where customers are acquired).
    *   **Konkurrenzbeobachtung:** (Competitor analysis).
    *   **Vertriebsstatus:** (Segmenting by sales maturity - prospect vs. existing customer).

#### Broader Range of Marketing Tactics:

*   **Offline Marketing:** OMR dedicates a section to classic offline marketing, including **Messen, Events und Kongresse** (Trade Fairs, Events, and Congresses). Your article is almost exclusively focused on digital channels.
*   **Empfehlungsmarketing (Referral Marketing):** OMR has a dedicated section explaining the power of customer referrals and mentions specific tactics like **Referral-Programme** or **Affiliate-Programme**.
*   **Guerilla-Marketing:** OMR introduces this creative, unconventional tactic for the B2B sector, adding depth and a sense of completeness to the marketing mix discussed.

#### Specific Social Media Strategy Applications:

*   While your article mentions social media as a channel, OMR details its strategic uses in B2B:
    *   **Informationen über Markt und Kunden:** (Using platforms for market and customer research).
    *   **Trends entdecken:** (Identifying market trends).
    *   **Platzierung als Experte:** (Positioning as an expert through content).
    *   **Kundenbindung:** (Customer retention and relationship building).
    *   **Social Media Advertising:** (Specifically calling out paid ads).

### Formatting and Structural Leverage

The OMR article uses a clearer, more scannable structure that enhances readability and is highly effective for SEO. It feels less like a corporate brochure and more like an encyclopedic entry.

#### Clear Hierarchical Headings:

*   OMR uses a logical `H2` -> `H3` -> `H4` structure. For example, "Prozesse im B2B-Marketing" (H2) contains "B2B-Kundensegmentierungs-Methoden" (H3), which is further broken down by specific methods using bolded paragraphs acting as H4s. Your article often uses bolded text for sub-topics (e.g., "Der Marketing-Funnel," "Lifecycle Marketing") where an `H3` heading would be more structurally appropriate for both users and search engines.

#### Concise Paragraphs and Strategic Bolding:

*   OMR's paragraphs are shorter and easier to digest. It uses **bold text** to highlight key terms and concepts (e.g., **Lead Scoring**, **SEO**), which helps users scan for important information and signals relevance to search crawlers.

#### Use of Lists:

*   OMR effectively uses bullet points to break down the applications of a B2B social media strategy, making the information easy to consume. Your article could benefit from this when listing channels or types of MarTech.

#### Recommendations for Restructuring Your Article:

1.  **Convert Bolded Sub-topics to H3 Headings:** In the section "Was ist B2B-Marketing?", change "Der Marketing-Funnel," "Lifecycle Marketing," "Nachfragegenerierung und Lead-Generierung," etc., from bolded paragraphs into proper `###` headings. This will improve the article's outline and scannability.
2.  **Create a Bulleted List for Marketing Channels:** In the section "Strategieentwicklung für B2B-Content-Marketing," instead of listing channels in a paragraph, reformat them into a clear, bulleted list. This improves readability instantly.
    *   **Before:** "Content-Marketing funktioniert auf jedem digitalen Marketingkanal, zum Beispiel: Websites, Blogs, Leitfäden, E-Books..."
    *   **After:**
        *   Websites
        *   Blogs
        *   Leitfäden
        *   E-Books
        *   ...and so on.
3.  **Add a "Key Takeaways" Box:** At the beginning of the article, after the introduction, insert a visually distinct box summarizing the 3-4 most important points. This caters to users who want a quick answer and can reduce bounce rates.
4.  **Break Down MarTech Section:** The section on "Nutzung der richtigen B2B-Marketing-Technologie" is very dense. Break it down with more subheadings. For example, create an `####` for each specialized tool (Marketing-Automatisierung, Marketinganalysen, etc.) instead of just bolding them.

### SEO & AI Search Optimization Strategy

To outrank the competitor and become a preferred source for AI Overviews, focus on semantic breadth, on-page precision, and demonstrating superior E-E-A-T.

#### Semantic and Long-Tail Keywords:

The OMR article effectively targets a broader set of user intent queries. Integrate these concepts and keywords into your article:

*   **Informational/How-to:** `B2B Kundensegmentierung Methoden`, `wie funktioniert B2B Marketing`, `B2B Marketing Beispiele`, `B2B Social-Media-Strategie entwickeln`.
*   **Comparative:** `Unterschiede B2B und B2C Marketing`.
*   **Tactic-specific:** `Empfehlungsmarketing B2B`, `Offline-Marketing für B2B`, `Lead Scoring Definition`.

#### On-Page Element Improvements:

*   **Title Tag:**
    *   **Current:** "Was ist B2B-Marketing? Definition, Typen und Strategien - Salesforce"
    *   **Proposed:** "**B2B-Marketing: Der umfassende Leitfaden für Strategien, Kanäle & Beispiele \| Salesforce**"
    *   *Rationale:* The proposed title is more active, includes the high-value keyword "Leitfaden" (guide), and adds "Kanäle" (channels) and "Beispiele" (examples), which directly addresses user intent for actionable information.

*   **Meta Description:**
    *   **Current:** "Erfahren Sie, wie Business-to-Business-Marketing (B2B-Marketing) Unternehmen dabei helfen kann, wichtige Zielgruppen anzusprechen, ihnen überzeugende Erfahrungen zu bieten und so den Umsatz zu steigern."
    *   **Proposed:** "**Alles über B2B-Marketing: Von der Definition und den Unterschieden zu B2C über Kundensegmentierung bis zu den besten Online- & Offline-Strategien zur Umsatzsteigerung.**"
    *   *Rationale:* This is more comprehensive, includes key concepts from the content gap analysis (Kundensegmentierung, Online & Offline), and provides a clearer promise of the article's value.

*   **Image Alt Text:** Ensure all images have descriptive alt text. Your current images are heavily product-focused. Add more conceptual images or diagrams.
    *   **Example:** Instead of only showing the Salesforce UI, include a diagram of the marketing funnel. The alt text could be: "**Diagramm des B2B-Marketing-Funnels mit den Phasen Awareness, Consideration und Decision.**"

#### E-E-A-T Recommendations for AI Search Readiness:

AI-powered search engines prioritize content from sources demonstrating strong Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness.

1.  **Demonstrate Experience (E):** Your article is very theoretical. Incorporate practical experience by:
    *   **Adding Mini Case Studies:** Include short, one-paragraph examples like: *"Beispielsweise nutzte ein mittelständisches Maschinenbauunternehmen unsere ABM-Strategie, um... "* This demonstrates that the concepts work in the real world.
    *   **Including "Pro-Tipps":** Add callout boxes with expert tips. For example, under the SEO section:
        > **Pro-Tipp:** Konzentrieren Sie sich auf Long-Tail-Keywords, die spezifische Probleme Ihrer B2B-Zielgruppe lösen. Diese haben oft eine höhere Konversionsrate.

2.  **Showcase Expertise (E):**
    *   **Author Bio:** The article lacks a clear author. Add a visible author bio box at the beginning or end, featuring a senior marketing expert from Salesforce with their title, experience, and a link to their LinkedIn profile. This directly connects the content to a human expert.
    *   **Cite External Data:** While your own reports are valuable, citing reputable third-party industry studies (e.g., from Gartner, Forrester, or academic journals) on B2B trends will enhance objectivity and showcase broader expertise.

3.  **Leverage Authoritativeness (A):**
    *   You are Salesforce, a massive authority. Make this clearer. At the beginning, frame the article's perspective: *"Mit über 20 Jahren Erfahrung in der Unterstützung von B2B-Unternehmen teilen wir die Strategien, die wir als führende CRM-Plattform als am effektivsten erachten."*

4.  **Build Trustworthiness (T):**
    *   **Balance Promotion with Education:** While the goal is to promote Salesforce products, the article will be more trustworthy if it first provides objective, universal advice. Structure sections to first explain the *what* and *why* of a strategy (e.g., Lead Nurturing) before explaining how Salesforce tools help with the *how*.
    *   **Add an FAQ Section:** Create a structured FAQ section at the end using Schema markup. Answer common questions directly, such as:
        *   "Was sind die wichtigsten B2B-Marketing-KPIs?"
        *   "Wie lange dauert ein typischer B2B-Verkaufszyklus?"
        *   "Welches Budget sollte man für B2B-Marketing einplanen?"
        This is excellent for capturing featured snippets and satisfying specific user queries, making your page a preferred source for AI Overviews.

## Compared with `https://blog.hubspot.de/marketing/b2b-marketing`

### Content Gap Analysis

The competitive article from HubSpot is significantly more comprehensive and addresses a wider range of user intents, especially for those in the early stages of research. Your article (Salesforce) focuses heavily on defining concepts and linking them to your products, whereas HubSpot's article acts as a broader educational resource.

Here are the specific content gaps in your article:

*   **Rationale/Justification:** HubSpot explicitly answers the question **"Warum lohnt sich B2B-Marketing?"** (Why is B2B Marketing Worthwhile?). This addresses a fundamental user question before diving into the "how."
*   **Strategic Planning:** HubSpot includes a section on creating a **B2B marketing strategy**, emphasizing the need for target audience analysis and defining a **Buyer Persona**. Your article discusses target audiences but not the strategic process of defining them.
*   **Concrete Examples:** This is the most significant gap. HubSpot provides two real-world **B2B marketing examples (Atlassian and Adobe)**, showcasing how successful companies implement these strategies (Content Hub, TikTok marketing). Your article lacks tangible case studies or examples, making the concepts more abstract.
*   **Third-Party Tools:** HubSpot recommends specific **B2B marketing tools** beyond its own ecosystem (Mailchimp, Brevo, Semrush). This builds trust by offering objective value. Your article only discusses *types* of technology (CRM, CDP) and immediately pivots to Salesforce products.
*   **Comprehensive List of Trends:** HubSpot features a detailed, scannable list of **22 specific B2B marketing trends**. Your article discusses trends like AI and data but in a more integrated, narrative style. HubSpot's list format is superior for users looking for quick insights. Specific trends you are missing include:
    *   **Agile Marketing**
    *   **Influencer-Marketing** (specifically Micro-Influencers)
    *   **Marketing-Podcasts**
    *   **Datenschutz (Data Privacy)** as a core challenge (Third-Party Cookies, GDPR)
    *   **ROI-Messung (ROI Measurement)** as a specific challenge
    *   **Nachhaltigkeit und Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)**
    *   **Interaktive Inhalte (Interactive Content)**
    *   **Conversational Marketing**
    *   **Voice Search**
    *   **Micro-Moments**
    *   **Predictive Marketing**

### Formatting and Structural Leverage

HubSpot's article excels in formatting, making complex information highly digestible and optimized for scanning. This enhances both user experience and SEO.

#### How the Competitor Uses Formatting Effectively:

*   **Comparison Table:** HubSpot uses a clear table to compare **B2B vs. B2C Marketing**. This is highly effective for quick comprehension and is prime content for being featured in Google's AI Overviews.
*   **Numbered Lists:** The core of the article is the **"22 B2B-Marketing-Trends"** numbered list. This structure is easy to scan, creates anticipation, and is favored by search algorithms for list-based queries.
*   **Blockquotes:** They use blockquotes to feature **expert opinions** (e.g., from Rob Illidge). This breaks up the text visually and adds authority.
*   **Embedded Media:** The inclusion of an **embedded TikTok video** from Adobe provides a dynamic, real-world example directly within the content.
*   **Whitespace and Short Paragraphs:** The article uses very short paragraphs, often 1-3 sentences, which significantly improves readability on all devices.
*   **Distinct CTAs:** Calls-to-action are placed in visually distinct, colored boxes (e.g., "The State of Marketing Report 2025"), separating them from the educational content.

#### Specific Recommendations for Your Article:

*   **Implement a Comparison Table:** Convert your section `"Worin unterscheidet sich B2B-Marketing von B2C-Marketing?"` from paragraphs into a **table** like HubSpot's. Use columns for "Aspekt" (Aspect), "B2B-Marketing," and "B2C-Marketing." (This has been done above under "Evaluation of Questions")
*   **Create a Scannable Trend List:** Restructure your content about trends into a dedicated section with a clear heading like `"Top B2B-Marketing-Trends, die Sie kennen sollten"`. Use a **numbered or bulleted list** to present each trend.
*   **Break Up Long Paragraphs:** Your sections, such as `"Strategieentwicklung für B2B-Content-Marketing, -Kanäle und -Messaging"`, are dense. Break this into multiple `###` subheadings like:
    *   `### Was ist B2B-Content-Marketing?`
    *   `### Die richtigen Kanäle für Ihre Zielgruppe`
    *   `### Empathie im B2B-Messaging`
*   **Use More Bolding:** Emphasize key concepts like **Marketing-Funnel**, **Lead Nurturing**, and **Account Based Marketing (ABM)** using bold text to guide the reader's eye.
*   **Incorporate a "Key Takeaways" Box:** Add a summary box near the top of the article with 3-4 bullet points summarizing the most important information. This caters to users who want a quick overview.

### SEO & AI Search Optimization Strategy

To outrank the competitor and become a preferred source for AI search, focus on semantic breadth, clear on-page signals, and demonstrating superior E-E-A-T.

#### Key Semantic & Long-Tail Phrases to Target:

HubSpot effectively targets a wide range of informational queries. You should integrate these concepts and phrases:

*   **`b2b marketing beispiele`** (b2b marketing examples)
*   **`b2b marketing trends [current year]`**
*   **`b2b marketing strategie entwickeln`** (develop b2b marketing strategy)
*   **`unterschied b2b und b2c marketing`** (difference between b2b and b2c marketing)
*   **`wichtige b2b marketing tools`** (important b2b marketing tools)
*   **`roi im b2b marketing messen`** (measure roi in b2b marketing)
*   **`account based marketing erklärt`** (account based marketing explained)

#### Concrete On-Page Element Improvements:

*   **Title Tag:**
    *   **Current:** `Was ist B2B-Marketing? Definition, Typen und Strategien - Salesforce`
    *   **Proposed:** `Was ist B2B-Marketing? Definition, Strategien, Trends & Beispiele - Salesforce`
    *   **Reasoning:** Adding "Trends" and "Beispiele" (Examples) makes the title more comprehensive and better matches the high-volume search queries that HubSpot is capturing.

*   **Meta Description:**
    *   **Current:** `Erfahren Sie, wie Business-to-Business-Marketing (B2B-Marketing) Unternehmen dabei helfen kann, wichtige Zielgruppen anzusprechen, ihnen überzeugende Erfahrungen zu bieten und so den Umsatz zu steigern.`
    *   **Proposed:** `Umfassender Leitfaden zum B2B-Marketing: Entdecken Sie die Unterschiede zu B2C, effektive Strategien, die neuesten Trends und praxisnahe Beispiele für Ihren Erfolg.`
    *   **Reasoning:** The proposed version is more active, includes more target keywords (Leitfaden, Unterschiede, Trends, Beispiele), and clearly communicates the article's value.

*   **Image Alt Text:**
    *   Your current alt text is not descriptive (e.g., `Titelseite des Salesforce-Reports „State of Marketing“`).
    *   **Recommendation:** Make alt text highly descriptive. For example, the image `1up-what-is-salesforce-marketing.png` should have alt text like: **`Screenshot der Salesforce Marketing Cloud, der den Drag-and-Drop-Prozess zur Erstellung einer Marketing-E-Mail zeigt.`** (Screenshot of Salesforce Marketing Cloud showing the drag-and-drop process for creating a marketing email). This helps with image search and accessibility.

#### Recommendations to Increase E-E-A-T:

1.  **Experience:**
    *   Integrate **real-world case studies or specific examples** of how companies (ideally your clients, with permission) have used the strategies you describe. Instead of just defining ABM, show it in action. This is the most critical E-E-A-T improvement you can make.

2.  **Expertise:**
    *   Add an **author bio** at the beginning or end of the article for a credible marketing expert from Salesforce. Include their title, years of experience, and a link to their LinkedIn profile.
    *   Incorporate **expert quotes** from your internal specialists or industry partners, similar to how HubSpot quoted Rob Illidge.

3.  **Authoritativeness:**
    *   Instead of just linking to your "State of Marketing" report, **embed key statistics and charts** from the report directly into the article's text. For example: *"Our 9th 'State of Marketing' report found that 69% of customers expect connected experiences. This means..."*. This transforms your article from a signpost into a primary source.

4.  **Trustworthiness:**
    *   Add a **"Last Updated" date** to the article. HubSpot does this ("Aktualisiert: 26. November 2024"), signaling to users and search engines that the information, especially the trends, is current and reliable.
