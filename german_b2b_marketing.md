# Evaluation of Ranking Performance

Based on the provided keywords and ranking data, the ranking goal for the URL https://www.salesforce.com/de/marketing/b2b-automation/b2b-marketing-guide/ is **Partially Achieved**.

## Summary of Analysis

*   The primary keyword "B2B Marketing" is ranking, but outside the desired top 3 positions.
*   Two of the three secondary keywords are ranking via very close semantic variants, also outside the top 3.
*   One secondary keyword, "B2B Content Marketing," does not appear in the provided ranking data.

Because the most important keywords are present in the rankings but not in the target positions, and one keyword is missing, this performance fits the definition of "Partially Achieved."

## Detailed Breakdown

Let's compare the target keywords to the actual ranking data:

### Primary Keyword: "B2B Marketing"

*   **Target:** B2B Marketing
*   **Actual:** Found ranking at position 5.

**Note:** A close variant, `b-to b marketing`, is ranking at position 3. This is a very positive sign, but the exact match is outside the top 3.

### Secondary Keyword: "B2B Online-Marketing"

*   **Target:** B2B Online-Marketing
*   **Actual:** A strong semantic equivalent, `b2b marketing digital`, is found ranking at position 12.

### Secondary Keyword: "B2B Marketing Strategie"

*   **Target:** B2B Marketing Strategie
*   **Actual:** A direct variant, `marketingstrategien b2b` (marketing strategies b2b), is found ranking at position 5.

### Secondary Keyword: "B2B Content Marketing"

*   **Target:** B2B Content Marketing
*   **Actual:** This keyword was not found in the provided list of rankings.

## Conclusion

The goal was not **Fully Achieved** because none of the exact target keywords are ranking in positions 1-3. It was also not **Not Achieved**, because the primary keyword and two secondary keywords are clearly represented in the rankings. Therefore, the performance is best described as **Partially Achieved**. The page has established relevance for the core topics but requires further optimization to reach the top positions and to rank for all its target keywords.
